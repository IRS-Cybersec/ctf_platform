# Sieberrsec CTF Platform
Sieberrsec CTF platform. A Jeopardy CTF platform designed with various neat features to aid in training and learning. Written in ReactJS and NodeJS

The platform is still currently in **early alpha** and in **active development**. There is unfortunately no easy way to deploy the platform at the moment, but we welcome any contributions to change this :smile:.

You can find a working copy of the platform [here](https://ctfx.irscybersec.tk) used by our club, but we are unfortunately unable to provide a demo account.

Feel free to take a look at the screenshots below for a peek at what the platform can do!

## Features

- "**Categories**" for better organization of challenges into different "events"
- **Sorting of challenges** by their tags
- **Announcements** with markdown support
- **Markdown supported Challenge Descriptions** that allow you to add **code blocks with syntax highlighting, math** and more
- **Writeup links** per challenge (along with the option to only release writeups after submitting the flag)
- **Challenge Creator Role** so as to allow challenge authors to submit challenges without having full admin access
- Links to each challenge so that individual challenges can be shared
- Easy management of challenges and users
  - Disable registration, change permissions etc.
- Juicy React-Spring transitions
